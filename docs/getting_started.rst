Getting Started
===============

Installation
============

PyDFT-QMMM can be installed directly from github using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/johnppederson/pydft-qmmm

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/johnppederson/pydft-qmmm
    $ cd pydft-qmmm
    $ pip install .

Optional QM engines
===================

The Psi4 interface is the default for :class:`QMHamiltonian`.  A PySCF
interface is also bundled, and is installed with the ``pyscf`` extra.
Select ``interface="pyscf-mol"`` for molecular calculations or
``interface="pyscf-pbc"`` for periodic calculations.

Install the optional dependencies with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install 'pydft_qmmm[pyscf,qmmm-pme]'

The supported model is a **molecular** QM region embedded in a
periodically replicated, fixed-charge MM environment.  The wavefunction
is restricted Kohn-Sham for a singlet and unrestricted Kohn-Sham for any
higher multiplicity.  This is not a :mod:`pyscf.pbc` periodic
wavefunction: there are no k-points, and the periodicity enters only
through the electrostatic environment that OpenMM and the PME machinery
provide.

The ``pyscf-pbc`` interface uses the simulation box as the QM cell.
It requires a GTH ``pseudo`` and a matching basis; ``ecp`` is unsupported.
Set ``ke_cutoff`` (Hartree) or ``mesh`` for the uniform FFT grid.
Sampling is a single k-point.

.. code-block:: python

    qm = QMHamiltonian(
        interface="pyscf-pbc",
        basis="gth-dzvp",
        pseudo="gth-pbe",
        functional="pbe",
        charge=0,
        multiplicity=1,
        ke_cutoff=200.0,
    )

Larger boxes increase QM cost. Converge ``ke_cutoff`` against forces;
energy convergence alone can leave large gradient errors.

To embed active QM atoms in a frozen QM density, add ``ksced`` to the same
periodic interface. This requires the ``pyscf-ksced`` plugin with analytic
gradients, installed or available through ``PYSCF_EXT_PATH``.

.. code-block:: python

    qm = QMHamiltonian(
        interface="pyscf-pbc",
        basis="gth-dzvp",
        pseudo="gth-pbe",
        functional="PBE",
        charge=0,
        multiplicity=1,
        mesh=(41, 41, 41),
        ksced={
            "active_atoms": [0, 1, 2],
            "frozen_atoms": [3, 4, 5],
            "basis_mode": "M",
            "t_nad": "LDA_K_TF",
        },
    )
    calculator = qm[0:3].build_calculator(system)
    result = calculator.calculate()

The active and frozen selections must be nonempty and disjoint. Each can be
a list of system atom indices or a selection string. Only active A belongs
to subsystem I. Frozen B stays in the MM region and is selected separately
as the KSCED environment. This keeps B–C interactions in the MM force field;
there is no frozen-density B–C electrostatic term.
The outer ``charge`` and ``multiplicity`` describe active A. Frozen B defaults
to charge 0 and multiplicity 1; set ``frozen_charge`` and
``frozen_multiplicity`` inside ``ksced`` to change them.

B is converged once and reused as A moves. The returned energy is E_ainb,
without B's constant self energy. Analytic A forces are placed in full-system
atom order; B rows are zero. With electrostatic embedding enabled, the energy
includes A–C electronic and nuclear coupling, and C receives reaction forces.
B's positions and the simulation box must
stay fixed. The interface does not constrain an integrator automatically.

This option supports Gamma-point ``basis_mode="M"` with GTH pseudopotentials,
FFTDF and pure LDA/GGA XC and kinetic functionals, on CPU or GPU using the
existing ``device`` option. Adding ``sigma`` and ``smearing_method="fermi"``
to the outer options applies fixed-electron-number smearing to A; its reported
energy is then the free energy differentiated by the forces. The interface's
``configure_electrostatic_embedding(True)`` enables the existing periodic
Gaussian charge field of region II. Added ``PMEElectronicPotential`` fields
supply region III reciprocal electrostatics. Both source sets exclude frozen B,
independently of B's II/III assignment. These fields couple only to A's density
and valence nuclear charges. Arbitrary added fields are rejected because their
source exclusions and force derivatives cannot be guaranteed.

Configure embedding before the first SCF. The Gaussian near field is periodic,
with its width set by ``embedding_sigma``; it is not an unsmoothed isolated
point-charge interaction. The returned components sum to the total energy.
Full OpenMM assembly still requires excluding A–B force-field terms while
retaining B–C terms; this interface does not perform that setup or freeze B.

For a molecular QM region:

.. code-block:: python

    qm = QMHamiltonian(
        interface="pyscf-mol",
        basis="def2-svp",
        functional="PBE0",
        charge=0,
        multiplicity=1,
        conv_tol=1e-9,
        max_cycle=100,
        grid_level=3,
    )
    mm = MMHamiltonian(forcefield=["forcefield.xml"])
    coupling = QMMMHamiltonian(
        "electrostatic",
        "electrostatic",
        coupling_mode="conservative",  # default
    )
    total = qm[qm_slice] + mm[mm_slice] + coupling

Subsystem II enters the QM Hamiltonian as :mod:`pyscf.qmmm` point
charges.  Subsystem III and the periodic images enter as a reciprocal
potential, sampled on the solver's own quadrature grid and contracted
into a one-electron operator.  Forces are analytic on both the QM atoms
and the MM sites.

The default conservative mode removes QM fixed-charge electrostatics
from both the OpenMM energy and its forces before adding the molecular
QM/MM terms.  ``coupling_mode="force"`` retains the historical
directional force mixing for compatibility, emits a warning, and is not
suitable when forces must be derivatives of the reported energy.

The solver follows the wavefunction unless one is named: Kohn-Sham
when a ``functional`` is given and Hartree-Fock otherwise, restricted
for a closed shell and unrestricted above it.  Naming ``method``
overrides that, and accepts ``rhf``, ``uhf``, ``rohf``, ``rks``,
``uks``, or ``roks``.  A Kohn-Sham method without a functional, a
Hartree-Fock method with one, and a restricted method on an open shell
are each refused rather than quietly reinterpreted.

``density_fit=True`` builds the Coulomb and exchange matrices from a
fitted auxiliary basis instead of the exact four-center integrals,
optionally with an explicit ``auxbasis``.  ``device="gpu"`` runs the
same calculation through GPU4PySCF; the embedding operators are still
built on the host and moved to the device, so the two agree to SCF
precision.

.. code-block:: python

    qm = QMHamiltonian(
        interface="pyscf-mol",
        basis="def2-svp",
        charge=0,
        multiplicity=1,
        method="rohf",
        density_fit=True,
        device="gpu",
    )

Unlike Psi4, PySCF does not infer an effective core potential from
the orbital basis, so a basis parameterized against one has to be paired
with it explicitly:

.. code-block:: python

    qm = QMHamiltonian(
        interface="pyscf-mol",
        basis="def2-svp",
        ecp="def2-svp",
        functional="PBE",
        charge=-1,
        multiplicity=1,
    )

Omitting ``ecp`` for such a basis is refused rather than silently
computed, because PySCF would otherwise place every electron, cores
included, into a valence-only basis and converge to a meaningless
energy.

An effective core potential also changes what the QM/MM/PME nuclear
term must use.  The wavefunction carries only the valence electrons, so
the matching nuclear charge is the atomic number less the electrons the
potential replaces -- 25 rather than 53 for iodine in a def2 basis.
Interfaces report that through :meth:`QMInterface.nuclear_charges`, and
the coupling Hamiltonian asks rather than assuming, so a QM region does
not enter the reciprocal sum with the wrong net charge.

``grid_level`` sets that quadrature.  The grid moves with the QM atoms,
and the terms that generates are omitted for the same reason PySCF omits
them from the exchange-correlation gradient by default, so the level
also sets how closely the analytic QM force tracks the energy: level 3
leaves roughly 0.07 kJ/mol/Angstrom on a single embedded water, and
level 5 roughly 0.003.

Examples
========

Several cases are provided in the example suite.  The CLI and Python API
are demonstrated in :example:`0`.  Enhanced sampling functionality with
Plumed is demonstrated in :example:`1`. Using AMBER or GROMACS forcefield
parameter files is demonstrated in :example:`2`.  QM/MM/PME with PySCF
as the QM engine is demonstrated in :example:`case 5 <5_pyscf>`, and a
heavy-atom QM region whose basis carries an effective core potential in
:example:`case 6 <6_pyscf_ecp>`.  :example:`Case 7 <7_pyscf_gpu>` repeats
case 5 on a GPU and compares the two devices.  :example:`Case 8
<8_pyscf_pbc>` uses a periodic ``pyscf.pbc`` wavefunction whose cell is
the simulation box.

Templates
=========

Templates for writing third-party plugins and interfaces are provided in
the templates folder in the project root directory.
